    <string name="sudoku_rules_1">Sudoku is a logic puzzle that consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into 9 3x3 squares. Some cells of the grid are already filled with numbers, while the other cells must be filled in by the player.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_2">The goal of the game is to fill all the cells of the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, so that each digit appears only once in every row, every column, and every 3x3 square.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_3">To start the game, select a cell that you want to fill in and tap on it. The selected cell will be highlighted.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_4">Next, select a number that you want to insert into the selected cell and tap on the button with that number on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_5">If the number you selected violates the rules of the game (for example, if it\'s already present in the same row, column, or 3x3 square), it will be highlighted in red.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_6">If the number you selected does not violate the rules of the game, it will be placed in the selected cell.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_7">Continue filling in the cells until you have filled in all the cells of the grid.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_8">If you get stuck and don\'t know what number to insert into a cell, you can tap on the "Hint" button on the toolbar to get a hint for the selected cell.</string>
    <string name="sudoku_rules_9">If you fill in all the cells correctly, congratulations, you have won the game!</string>
